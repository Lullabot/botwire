Botwire
=======

A starter kit for HTML wireframes that uses Jekyll and Sass to break wireframes down into easily reusable components. It borrows from (or allows you to) several existing frameworks for things like a grid-system (bourbon neat), ready-made styles (bourbon and bourbon bitters), and more (e.g. foundation can be optionally enabled).
